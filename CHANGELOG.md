# Changelog

All notable changes to this template are documented in this file.

The format follows Keep a Changelog and the project uses semantic versioning for template releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository-owned UI foundation inspired by shadcn with semantic OKLCH tokens.
- Project-level `brand.css` for hue, chroma, lightness, chart, and dark-theme customization.
- Light, dark, and system appearance modes with a CSP-safe, flash-free bootstrap.
- Compact and comfortable density modes.
- Shared alert, avatar, badge, button, card, checkbox, dialog, input, label, select, separator, sheet, skeleton, switch, table, tabs, textarea, and tooltip primitives.
- App shell, confirmation dialog, typed data table, empty state, error state, form field, loading state, page container, page header, pagination, search input, settings section, and stat card patterns.
- `/ui` core playground and `/ui-advanced` product-pattern playground.
- `typeset` rich-content styling for markdown, documentation, and AI output.
- Compatible Radix Nova shadcn CLI configurations and package aliases for the web and shared UI workspaces.
- Exact-version `ui:info` and `ui:add` commands for reviewing and adding repository-owned component source.
- Local Markdown link validation as part of `bun run check`.
- Capability dependency, disabled-artifact, version-sync, license-policy, and UI-configuration validation.
- Synchronized `version:set` command with dry-run support for package, Tauri, and Cargo metadata.
- Project bootstrap, contribution, release, licensing, and repository-governance documentation.
- Structured bug report and feature request forms plus an expanded pull-request checklist.
- Cross-platform editor and source normalization through `.editorconfig` and `.gitattributes`.
- Repository `CODEOWNERS` and dry-run-first repository metadata and branch-protection applicators.
- Isolated fresh-template consumer smoke test covering install, checks, SSR build, and native web build.
- Exact-version axe accessibility audit for public product and UI routes in light and dark themes.
- Accessibility JSON reports retained with browser test artifacts.
- Explicit private `UNLICENSED` policy without imposing an open-source license on generated products.
- Regression coverage for inherited log context, nested secrets, arrays, and circular references.
- Dedicated architecture, deployment, native, UI, release, project bootstrap, licensing, governance, and template customization documentation.

### Changed

- Refactored the starter product flow to use semantic UI primitives rather than hardcoded Zinc and red utilities.
- Reworked `RULES.md` to contain engineering and coding standards only.
- Moved template operation and module removal instructions to `README.md` and `docs/template-customization.md`.
- Reduced `AGENTS.md` to repository navigation, validation, and documentation responsibilities.
- Added UI as an explicit capability in `template.config.ts`.
- Replaced the custom mobile navigation overlay with a focus-managed native sheet.
- Added arrow, Home, and End keyboard navigation to tabs.
- Replaced the inline appearance script with a same-origin external script compatible with the Tauri CSP.
- Expanded the README with GitHub template usage, project initialization, UI CLI, governance, and release guidance.
- Extended template validation to reject incomplete capability removal, missing license policy, and mismatched release versions.
- Expanded CI with documentation, fresh-consumer, and accessibility gates without changing runner targets.

### Fixed

- Structured log redaction now returns a type-safe object before spreading into log entries.
- Circular arrays no longer recurse indefinitely, and repeated references are represented as `[Circular]`.
- Branch-protection configuration preserves existing required checks unless replacement or clearing is explicit.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Root feature manifest and validation command for optional template capabilities.
- Bun dependency catalogs, isolated workspace installs, and a supply-chain release-age gate.
- Biome formatting and linting.
- Typed server, client, native, and test environment validation.
- Versioned Drizzle migrations with drift verification.
- Complete Better Auth schema, organization support, custom permissions, and native bearer support.
- Protected API routes and authentication integration tests.
- Domain and application layers with infrastructure adapters.
- Structured logs, request IDs, metrics, and optional OpenTelemetry export.
- Hardened production Compose topology and optional observability services.
- Dependency automation, CodeQL, dependency review, secret scanning, image scanning, SBOMs, and provenance.
- OCI container release workflow and native desktop/mobile build workflow.
- Expanded unit, PostgreSQL integration, browser, authentication, and authorization coverage.

### Changed

- Docker deployment applies committed migrations without generating SQL at runtime.
- CI uses reproducible `bun ci` installs and validates migration drift.
- Browser API and authentication clients use same-origin requests by default.
- Runtime containers install or copy only production requirements and run without root privileges.

### Removed

- Unbounded dependency versions from workspace package manifests.
- Runtime migration generation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-22

- PostgreSQL integration tests and Playwright E2E smoke coverage.
- Multi-job GitHub Actions pipeline for quality, builds, integration tests, and full-stack E2E.

### Fixed

- Empty browser API URL handling in same-origin deployments.
- TanStack route generation before type checking.
- GitHub Actions runtime deprecation warnings by upgrading core actions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added
