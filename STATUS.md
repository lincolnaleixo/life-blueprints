# Current Status

Last reviewed: 2026-08-23

This file is the persistent handoff point for continuing work on `matrix-hq/code-template`.

## Baseline

The latest completed repository-side baseline before this status document is:

```text
aa185b8bb8eb5fcec774f93c13e9fb413dc3ef6d
```

PR #7 completed the final quality and governance package. The template remains at version `0.3.0`; the next release work is intentionally kept under `Unreleased` until executable validation is complete.

The detailed continuation checklist lives in GitHub issue #8:

```text
https://github.com/matrix-hq/code-template/issues/8
```

## Completed

Do not redo these areas unless an executable failure proves a concrete defect:

- production-oriented Bun and TypeScript monorepo architecture
- React and TanStack Start web application
- Bun, Elysia, and Eden API
- PostgreSQL and committed Drizzle migrations
- Better Auth, organizations, roles, browser cookies, native bearer sessions, and server-side authorization
- S3-compatible storage with MinIO for local development
- Docker Compose and Caddy topology
- structured logging, request IDs, metrics, and optional OpenTelemetry
- Capacitor and Tauri thin wrappers
- repository-owned semantic OKLCH UI system
- light, dark, and system themes plus compact and comfortable density
- `/ui` and `/ui-advanced` playgrounds
- shadcn monorepo configuration
- KISS/YAGNI-focused engineering rules
- README, contribution, bootstrap, customization, UI, licensing, governance, deployment, native, and release documentation
- capability, dependency, UI, documentation-link, and synchronized-version validation
- logger secret-redaction fix and regression tests
- axe accessibility audit command
- isolated fresh-template consumer smoke command
- CODEOWNERS
- explicit private `UNLICENSED` policy for the template
- dry-run-first repository metadata and branch-protection commands
- GitHub Template Repository setting

## Intentionally pending

### 1. Runner routing

The organization already documents:

```text
runner-linux-01
  [self-hosted, linux, x64, matrix]

runner-macos-01
  [self-hosted, matrix, macOS, ARM64]
```

The `code-template` workflows still request GitHub-hosted labels. Runner routing is intentionally deferred to a separate session.

There is no shared Matrix Windows runner documented yet. Decide whether to add one or gate Windows validation until it exists.

### 2. Full executable validation

After runner routing is corrected, execute and record:

```bash
bun ci
bun run check
bun run build
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com bun run build:native
bun run test:integration
bun run test:template-consumer
bun run test:a11y
bun run test:e2e
```

Also validate Docker images, full Compose readiness, PostgreSQL migrations from an empty database, auth integration, Playwright through Caddy, security scans, Tauri targets, Android, and iOS.

### 3. Real GitHub template consumer proof

Create a temporary repository with **Use this template**, follow `docs/project-bootstrap.md`, run the minimal product lifecycle, and confirm there are no hidden assumptions tied to the source repository.

`bun run test:template-consumer` is useful but does not replace the real GitHub template-generation proof.

### 4. Administrative GitHub settings

Known current state:

```text
is_template: true
description: empty
topics: empty
main branch protection: not yet applied or confirmed
```

Prepared commands:

```bash
GITHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN=... bun run repo:metadata --apply
GITHUB_ADMIN_TOKEN=... bun run repo:protect --apply
```

Apply required CI check names only after the final runner-backed check names are stable.

### 5. Release 0.4.0

Do not publish `0.4.0` until retained platforms have executable evidence.

When validation is complete:

```bash
bun run version:set 0.4.0 --dry-run
bun run version:set 0.4.0
```

Then move `Unreleased` entries into a dated `0.4.0` section, rerun release checks, create `v0.4.0`, verify artifacts, and repeat the fresh-template proof.

## Resume order

When continuing in another session, use this order:

1. read this file and issue #8
2. fix runner routing only
3. run minimal Linux and macOS probes
4. run the full executable validation set
5. fix only defects proven by those checks
6. run the real GitHub template consumer proof
7. apply repository metadata and branch protection
8. publish `0.4.0`
9. close issue #8

## Definition of done

The template is ready for `0.4.0` when runner routing is intentional, all retained platform claims have executable evidence, the generated-consumer path is proven, GitHub governance is applied, and the release can be reproduced from its tag without overstating unsupported platforms.
