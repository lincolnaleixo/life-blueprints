# Contributing

This repository is a product template. Changes should improve the default without making every generated project carry unnecessary complexity.

## Before changing code

1. Read [RULES.md](RULES.md).
2. Read the relevant architecture or operational document under [`docs/`](docs/architecture.md).
3. Check `template.config.ts` when the change adds, removes, or couples capabilities.
4. Review [docs/repository-governance.md](docs/repository-governance.md) for ownership or repository-policy changes.
5. Prefer a small, reversible change over a speculative framework or abstraction.

## Change workflow

1. Create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Keep the change scoped to one problem.
3. Add or update tests at the level where the behavior can fail.
4. Update documentation when commands, architecture, configuration, or supported behavior changes.
5. Add an entry under `Unreleased` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a material change.
6. Open a pull request using the repository template and explain any validation marked not applicable.

Commit messages should describe intent and use a conventional prefix when practical, for example:

```text
feat(ui): add a reusable command palette
fix(auth): preserve native bearer sessions
chore(deps): update the TanStack group
docs: clarify project initialization
```

## Architecture boundaries

- Product-independent rules belong in `packages/domain`.
- HTTP validation, cookies, status codes, and request context belong in `apps/api`.
- Database, storage, telemetry, and provider details belong in infrastructure adapters.
- Shared UI primitives and patterns belong in `packages/ui`.
- Product-specific compositions belong in `apps/web` or a product feature package.
- Native wrappers should remain thin and expose narrow adapters to shared TypeScript code.

Do not introduce imports that reverse the dependency direction documented in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Dependencies

Before adding a package, confirm that the platform or an existing dependency cannot satisfy the requirement cleanly.

When a dependency is justified:

1. pin an exact version in the root Bun catalog
2. reference it with `catalog:` from the consuming workspace
3. update `bun.lock`
4. review maintenance, security, runtime, and bundle cost
5. update Renovate grouping when the package belongs to an existing dependency family

Do not add an unbounded version or a second tool that duplicates an existing responsibility.

Test-only tools that install into an isolated temporary workspace must still pin exact versions, document why they are isolated, preserve the repository lockfile, and fail clearly when installation or execution fails.

## Database and authentication

Schema changes require committed migrations:

```bash
bun run auth:generate   # when Better Auth configuration changed
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run test:integration
```

Review generated SQL before committing it. Deployment applies committed migrations and never generates schema changes.

Authentication changes should test identity, session transport, authorization, and denied access separately.

## UI changes

Use semantic tokens and preserve keyboard, focus, reduced-motion, light-theme, and dark-theme behavior.

The shadcn CLI is configured for the monorepo. Run it from the app workspace so UI primitives are routed into `packages/ui` and app-level blocks or compositions are routed into `apps/web`:

```bash
bun run ui:info
bun run ui:add button
```

Generated source is a starting point, not an opaque dependency. Review the diff, align it with repository conventions, export shared components deliberately, and add a representative example to `/ui` or `/ui-advanced`.

When shared UI or product layout changes, run the applicable Playwright flow and the axe audit against the full stack:

```bash
bun run test:e2e
bun run test:a11y
```

Automation supports, but does not replace, manual keyboard, screen-reader, zoom, and native-WebView review.

See [docs/ui.md](docs/ui.md).

## Validation

Use the smallest validation set that fully covers the change, then expand it when risk crosses a boundary.

| Change | Minimum validation |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation only | `bun run docs:check`, `bun run lint:ci` |
| TypeScript or shared package | `bun run check` |
| API or database | `bun run check`, `bun run test:integration` |
| Web or shared UI | `bun run check`, `bun run build`, Playwright and accessibility checks |
| Docker or deployment | Compose configuration, image builds, readiness, E2E |
| Bootstrap, layout, package metadata | `bun run test:template-consumer` |
| Mobile or desktop | `bun run build:native` and the retained platform build |
| Governance or ownership | dry-run `bun run repo:protect`, review CODEOWNERS and licensing docs |
| Release mechanics | Follow [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) |

A checkbox may be marked not applicable only with a short reason. Do not claim a command passed when it did not run.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, tokens, certificates, production connection strings, or private customer data.
- Do not weaken authentication, authorization, CSP, container isolation, or workflow permissions merely to make a test pass.
- Redact sensitive fields from logs and examples.
- Add regression coverage when changing redaction, credential handling, or security boundaries.
- Report security issues using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

## Licensing and ownership

The template is private and explicitly `UNLICENSED`. Changes that introduce copied source, assets, fonts, icons, generated SDKs, or distributable binaries must consider their license and attribution obligations.

Do not add a public license or change ownership policy without an explicit repository-owner decision. See [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md).

## Generated projects

When adapting this repository into a product, follow [docs/project-bootstrap.md](docs/project-bootstrap.md). Remove unused capabilities completely rather than leaving dormant code, services, dependencies, or workflows. Replace template code owners and choose the product's real license before feature development or external distribution.
